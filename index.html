  <p>Hey there, thanks for stopping by to learn more about me.</p>
  <p>I wrote my first line of code at 39 after becoming unfulfiled</p>
  <p>in the investment industry. It's been a very long road and </p>
  <p>and Ive definitely wanted to throw the keyboard across the room a few times.</p>
  <p>However, it's all part of the process. Learning a new skill is challenging, as it should be.</p>
  <p>Anything worth having is worth working for. So my advice is to just keep swimming. If I can </p>
  <p>learn to code anyone can learn to code. You got this! </p>
